                  This was my capstone project for Computer Engineering Technology Diploma, created in collaboration with my teammate Steven Choi. We thought of creating 
                  this project to explore the real-time presence and remote control. We made a robot car whose movement was controlled using a mobile app. A camera component was 
                  added to the car that streamed the real-time video to a web browser so that the user can operate it successfully.

                   <h2 style="font-style: bold;">Hardware Components:</h2>
                   Raspberry Pi was used as a small computer for the robotic car. The hardware design of the robot centers on a 4-wheel drive car design, with each wheel controlled by a DC motor.
                   The motor controllers are powered by five AA batteries, providing a voltage supply of 7.5V DC, while the Raspberry Pi is powered by a separate phone battery at 5V DC. 2A L298N dual-motor controllers  and some pushbuttons were used.
                   For the camera component, the Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2 was used.
                   <h2 style="font-style: bold;">Software Components:</h2>
                   Python was ultimately chosen for development on the Raspberry Pi for its compatibility, ease of use, and open-source support. Two Python files were created: One to use the open-source GPIO Zero library to access the GPIO pins and provide
                    functions for controlling the car movement, and one to connect to the mobile app and respond to user instructions. All the functionality for the movement of the car – Forward, Backward, Left, Right, and Stop – was imported from the GPIO Zero library.
                     Sockets were used to receive messages from the mobile app connected to the same network. 
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The mobile app was designed to allow the user to control the car’s movement. Xamarin was chosen to be the platform for developing the mobile app using C# in Visual Studio. 
                     To establish the connection between the Pi and the mobile app, UDP was chosen.
