                <p1 style="font-size: large;">  This is a website created for a Golf Club that allows the players to book tee times and submit standing tee time requests electronically.
                A login page has been created that asks for the credentials and matches them with the username and password stored in the database.
                After login, the players are re-directed to the homepage based on their membership levels. Gold level players are allowed to book tee times and submit standing tee time requests
                whereas silver and bronze level members are taken to a page where they can just book tee times for themselves.

                <h3 style="font-style: bold;">Tools used:</h3>
            Visual Studio, DBMS, ASP.NET Razor Pages, HTML, CSS, C#, Javascript, T-SQL, etc.


            <h3 style="font-style: bold;">Additional Notes:</h3>
            This project is currently in progress and I am working on the layout and design of the website. Additional functionality will be added to the website as well and the result will be
            a complete system for a golf club that can be used by the staff, players and prospective members.
