                <p1 style="font-size: large;">  I'm part of a team of four people working on this ongoing project. A system that consists of an internal software application and a website for a business portfolio is being developed for a dry cleaners.
                    For this project, we are collaborating with a real-world client.
                    We are completing this project by using UML patterns.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Four phases of this project are Inception, Elaboration, Construction and Transition. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>Inception Phase:</b> During this stage, we spoke with our client and compiled a rough feature list of everything they requested. After that, all of the requirements were gathered, including with use cases and additional specifications, and inception documentation was completed.
                    To reduce any future issues that might occur during development, a Risk List and RequirementsÂ ranking list were made as parts of this document.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>Elaboration Phase:</b> For the main risk use cases, we created classes, implementation diagrams, database entities, and stored procedures during this step.
                    To make sure that the fundamental functionality is operating, test procedures were designed and testing was conducted.
